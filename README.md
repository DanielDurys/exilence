## Important

We do not yet have a code-signing certificate for the application, which means you will receive a warning the first time you launch the .exe. To get around this, just press "More info" -> "Run anyway" when it pops up, and the warning won't be shown again. We're working on maintaining a code-signing certificate for the application.

- .NET Core 2.1.0-rc1-final
