                1. My app suddently stopped updating and seems out of sync?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>If this happens, it's most likely due to us updating the API, which disconnects you. Restart the app to continue using it. If it keeps happening after restarting, file a bug-report.</p>

                2. How often does my character update?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>This is variable depending on which tab you have selected. Currency-information is updated approximately once very 5 minutes, but your character and inventory is updated each time you enter a new zone.</p>

                3. Why does my character not update at all?
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>Make sure you've entered a valid path to Client.txt when logging in. If it still doesn't work, try starting the app as administrator.</p>

                4. My inventory is not displayed at all, only equipment
            </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>This is most likely caused from an invalid or missing sessionId. Logout/restart the app and re-enter your sessionId. If the problem persists, contact us on discord.</p>
